        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>(For HTML demonstration purposes, I'm including the recipe from <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/systlin/174126510710/so-one-of-the-most-common-things-i-see-on-my-mead" rel="noopener noreferrer">this Tumblr post</a>. I've formatted it and done some basic edits for grammar and clarity: it's much funnier in the original format.)</p>
        <p>So one of the most common things I see on my mead posts is “I’d love to do that, but I don't have the stuff.”</p>

        <p>Well, sit down and buckle up, because I'm about to show you how to make a $12.56 traditional mead.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 gallon Deer Park/spring water. You don't want distilled.</li>
            <li>3 lb or 32 fluid ounces honey.</li>
            <li>One packet of yeast.</li>
            <li>A party balloon.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put everything together on a clean work surface. You will need a clean glass, and while not entirely necessary, a measuring cup will be handy.</li>
            <li>Pour a cup of water for yourself and drink it. Hydration is important. Also, this will allow you headspace.</li>
            <li>Remove about a quart or so of water to drink later.</li>
            <li>Wash your drinking cup, and mix about a teaspoon of honey with some water.</li>
            <li>Add a packet of yeast to the honey water.</li>
            <li>Stick your bottle of honey into some hot water to warm it up.</li>
            <li>Go outside. Breathe the free air. Know what it is... to truly live.</li>
            <li>Enough of that, bitch. Honey's hot. Put it in the jug of water.</li>
            <li>Put some water in the jug of honey, too.</li>
            <li>Shake the sin out of it.</li>
            <li>Put that stuff (the water and honey in the honey bottle) back in the big bitch (the water jug).</li>
            <li>Shake the sh*t out of it.</li>
            <li>Hydrate yourself with the water you removed earlier.</li>
            <li>Shank a balloon with a pin.</li>
            <li>Add your yeasty honey water to the water jug.</li>
            <li>Balloon it. (Stretch the neck of the balloon and put it over the opening of the water jug.)</li>
            <li>Label it.</li>
            <li>If your trad mead says anything racist, or anything positive about Hitler, straighten that sh*t out. (See image at top.)</li>
            <li>Stick it somewhere dark and leave it alone for a a while. Shake the hell outta it once a day for the first four days. Then let it be until it's clear.</li>
        </ol>
